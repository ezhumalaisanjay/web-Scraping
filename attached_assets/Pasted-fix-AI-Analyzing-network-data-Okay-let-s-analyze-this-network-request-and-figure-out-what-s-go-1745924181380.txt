Analyzing network data
Okay, let's analyze this network request and figure out what's going on and how to fix it.

Request Purpose:

URL: https://main.d2pexue81kyiub.amplifyapp.com/scrape/
The URL suggests this request is intended to retrieve content from a /scrape/ endpoint on a web application hosted on AWS Amplify. The domain main.d2pexue81kyiub.amplifyapp.com indicates it is an Amplify-hosted app. The path name /scrape/ may be to scrape the contents of the page.
Method: GET
A standard GET request, which indicates the client is requesting data from the server.
Request Headers:
accept: text/html,...: The client is primarily requesting HTML content.
referer: https://main.d2pexue81kyiub.amplifyapp.com/batch/: The request originated from the /batch/ page on the same domain, it means that the user was on the batch page, and the request for the scrape page was triggered from there.
cache-control: no-cache, pragma: no-cache: The client explicitly requests that the response should not be cached. This might be because the page contains dynamic content.
user-agent: Mozilla/5.0...: Standard web browser user agent.
Response Headers
access-control-allow-origin: *: This is a CORS header that allows the resource to be accessed by requests from any origin. This is useful for cross-domain requests, but it is generally recommended to restrict this to specific origins for security reasons.
content-encoding: br: The server is using Brotli compression to reduce the size of the response payload.
content-type: text/html: The server confirms it is sending HTML content, as the client requested.
server: AmazonS3: It shows that the server is Amazon S3, it means that the page's files are stored there.
strict-transport-security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains: Enforces HTTPS for the domain and its subdomains.
x-cache: <redacted>: The CloudFront caching status is redacted.
Timing Analysis:

Queueing: Minimal (0.61 ms).
Connection Start (Stalled): Very short (0.75ms).
Request Sent: Very quick (0.31 ms).
Waiting (TTFB): 312.00 ms. This is where most of the time is spent. It represents the time from when the request is sent until the first byte of the response is received. This delay may be the server processing time, network latency, or a combination of both.
Content Download: (0.55ms) very quick.
Overall Duration: 314.23ms.
Status Code:

404 Not Found: This is a critical issue. The server is telling us that the requested resource (/scrape/) does not exist at the provided location.
Potential Issues and Fixes:

Missing Resource: The primary issue is the 404 status code. The server cannot find the resource at the /scrape/ path.
Possible Causes:
Incorrect URL: There might be a typo in the URL used to make the request in the batch page.
Missing Endpoint: The /scrape/ endpoint might not be properly configured or deployed on the server.
Routing Issues: There could be a routing misconfiguration on the server or in AWS Amplify.
Deployment Issues: The code for this endpoint might not have been successfully deployed.
Fixes:
Verify the URL: Double-check the URL in the code or in the batch page where this request is triggered. Ensure it is precisely /scrape/ with no extra characters, spaces, or incorrect casing.
Check Server Configuration: If you have access to the server (AWS Amplify console or relevant deployment platform), check if there is a route or endpoint defined for /scrape/. Ensure that the endpoint is properly mapped to the correct handler function.
Review Deployment: If there was a recent deployment, ensure it was successful. Check for any errors or warnings in the deployment logs.
Test with other endpoints: If other endpoints work correctly, the issue is most likely with the /scrape/ endpoint itself.
Test with different paths: If other paths of the same application are also not working correctly, the issue may be on the server or networking.
Slow Time to First Byte (TTFB): 312.00 ms is a noticeable delay, even though it's not extreme.
Possible Causes:
Server Processing Time: If the /scrape/ endpoint (when it exists) involves complex logic or data processing, it could cause this delay.
Server Location: If the server is geographically distant from the users, network latency could be a factor.
S3 cold starts: The requests to S3 bucket can be slow, especially when it is the first time that the user hits the server.
Fixes:
Optimize code: Review the code of the /scrape/ endpoint to see if there are any performance improvements that can be made.
Improve server performance: If the server performance is generally slow, it can be improved by scaling up the resources or choosing a server closer to the user base.
Use a CDN: Content Delivery Networks like CloudFront can cache content closer to users, reducing latency.
Database optimization: If the slowness is caused by database queries, it can be improved by optimizing them.
access-control-allow-origin: *: It is generally better to allow cross-origin requests only from trusted domains.
Possible fixes
Specify origins: Replace the wildcard with an specific list of origins.
Summary of Recommendations:

Fix the 404 Error: The most urgent issue is the missing resource. Investigate the endpoint definition, deployment, and URL accuracy.
Optimize TTFB: Once the 404 is resolved, address the TTFB, primarily by optimizing the server code or the resources that it uses.
Improve CORS policy: Modify the CORS policy to allow only trusted origins.
By addressing these points, you should be able to get the /scrape/ endpoint working correctly and improve its performance.
